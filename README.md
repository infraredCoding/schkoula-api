# Schkoula - A web based study/school tracker for students

## What is it actually?
As a stuident myself, I often find iot difficult to keep track of all the assignments, exams, classes and whatnot. So, instead of relying on a general-purpose todo app, I decided to make my own system (like any normal guy would do, right?)

My objective with this project is to build a dedicated software solution to keep track of all the school activities, whether it is exams, assignments you name it.

## About this repo
This github repository only deals with the backend aspect of the project, which includes REST API endpoints, DB connection, Authentication etc. Technologies used in this codebase:
- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Development status
Currently the project is in early development stage. It is, by no means, production ready. For me, this is a passion project and I'll try to work on it as much as possible and try to deliver an awesome user experience to fellow students like me.
